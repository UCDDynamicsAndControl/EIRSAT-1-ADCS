abstract = {The primary purpose of this work was to develop control laws for three axis stabilization of a magnetic actuated satellite. This was achieved by a combination of linear and non- linear system theory. In order to reach this goal new theoretical results were produced in both ﬁelds. The focus of the work was on the class of periodic systems reﬂecting orbital motion of the satellite. In addition to a theoretical treatment, the thesis contains a large portion of application considerations. The controllers developed were implemented for the Danish {\O}rsted satellite. The control concept considered was that interaction between the Earth's magnetic ﬁeld and a magnetic ﬁeld generated by a set of coils in the satellite can be used for actuation. Magnetic torquing was found attractive for generation of control torques on small satel- lites, since magnetic control systems are relatively lightweight, require low power and are inexpensive. However, this principle is inherently nonlinear and difﬁcult to use, because control torques can only be generated perpendicular to the geomagnetic ﬁeld vector. So far, this has prevented control in all three axes using magnetorquers only. A fact that the geomagnetic ﬁeld changed periodically when a satellite is on a near po- lar low Earth orbit was used throughout this thesis. Conﬁned computer capacity and a limit on electrical power supply were separate obstacles. They demanded computational simplicity and power optimality from the attitude control system. The design of quasi optimal controllers for a real-time implementation was a subject of considerations in the part on linear control methods for a satellite with a gravity gradient boom. Both time varying and constant gain controllers were developed and their performance was tested via simulation. The nonlinear controller for a satellite without appendages was given in the second part of the thesis. Its design was based on sliding mode control theory. The essence of the sliding control presented in the thesis was to split the controller design into two steps: a sliding manifold design and a sliding condition design. The emphasis was on the sliding condition design, which was stated as a continuous function of the state. A control law for magnetic actuated satellite was proposed. Complete comprehension of the nature of the satellite control problem required a new ap- viiproach merging the nonlinear control theory with physics of the rigid body motion and an extension of earlier results in this ﬁeld using the theory of periodic systems. The Lya- punov stability theory was employed based on the potential and kinetic energy of the rigid satellite. A velocity controller, that contributes to dissipation of both kinetic and potential energy, was proposed. The velocity control was shown to provide four stable equilibria, one of which was the desired orientation. It was explained how the equilibria depended on the ratio of the satellite's moments of inertia. It was further investigated how to control the attitude, such that the satellite was globally asymptotically stable in the desired orientation, avoiding the undesired equilibria. The main contribution of this work was to show that three axis control can be achieved with magnetorquers as sole actuators in a low Earth orbit. A rigorous stability analysis was presented, and detailed simulation results showed convincing performance over the entire envelope of operation of the Danish {\O}rsted satellite. The key results have also been published in international papers},

abstract = {Nano-satellites provide space access to broader range of satellite developers and attract interests as an application of the space developments. These days several new nano-satellite missions are proposed with sophisticated objectives such as remote-sensing and observation of astronomical objects. In these advanced missions, some nano-satellites must meet strict attitude requirements for obtaining scientific data or images. For LEO nano-satellite, a magnetic attitude disturbance dominates over other environmental disturbances as a result of small moment of inertia, and this effect should be cancelled for a precise attitude control. This research focuses on how to cancel the magnetic disturbance in orbit. This paper presents a unique method to estimate and compensate the residual magnetic moment, which interacts with the geomagnetic field and causes the magnetic disturbance. An extended Kalman filter is used to estimate the magnetic disturbance. For more practical considerations of the magnetic disturbance compensation, this method has been examined in the PRISM (Pico-satellite for Remote-sensing and Innovative Space Missions). This method will be also used for a nano-astrometry satellite mission. This paper concludes that use of the magnetic disturbance estimation and compensation are useful for nano-satellites missions which require a high accurate attitude control. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

De- signing an attitude control system (ACS) to fit within the envelope of CINEMA is a critical development process for the mission. The ACS design, implementation and tests for this type of spacecraft have to rely mainly on simulations. A complete simulation of the space- craft environment and the ACS system is created to verify the ACS design. The simulation verifies that the ACS is capable of achieving the desired orientation without ground com- munication, while maintaining a power and thermal-safe orientation.},

In the paper, conditions for the complete controllability for the case of a magnetically controlled satellite with passive air drag panels are developed, and simulation case studies with the LQR and MPC control designs applied in combination with a nonlinear time-varying input transformation are presented to demonstrate the ability of the closed-loop system to satisfy mission objectives despite disturbance torques.},

We give necessary and sufficient conditions for controllability of the system in the case that the gas jet actuators yield one, two, or three independent torques. In the case of momentum exchange devices, controllability is studied with three independent actuators, and controllability is shown to be impossible with fewer devices. The former conditions with gas jet actuators are presented in three equivalent ways, and an equivalence is established with an earlier condition by Baillieul. The local controllability problem is also studied in the case of gas jet actuators yielding two independent torques. Using these results, an algorithm stabilizing the controllable system around an equilibrium state and trajectory is outlined, as proposed by Hermes. In the situations considered, however, the linearized systems are not controllable.},

abstract = {Funded by the NSF CubeSat and NASA ELaN a programs, the DICE mission con-sists of two 1.5U CubeSats which were launched into an eccentric low Earth orbit on October 28 1 h, 20 II. Each identical spacecraft carries a suite of ionospheric space weather payloads. The use of two identical CubeSats, at slightly different orbiting velocities in nearly identical orbits, permits the deconvolution of spatial and temporal ambiguities in the observations of the ionosphere from a moving platform. Deployable wire booms require each CubeSat to be spin stabilized. At-titude determination and control are accomplished using magnetometers, a sun sensor, and torque coils. Position and time are provided by GPS. DICE has greatly advanced nano-satellite based mission capabilities, demonstrat-ing constellation science and opening up a number of groundbreaking technolo-gies to the CubeSat community. DICE has made many co-incident observations of ionospheric structure and is the first CubeSat mission to observe field-aligned currents in the ionosphere. In this paper we will review the on-orbit performance ofthe DICE ADCS design as well as communications/GPS antenna issues asso-ciated with a spinning CubeSat.},

abstract = {This thesis deals with the analysis and design of the attitude control system for the AAU CubeSat. The goal is to design both a controller and actu- ators, which will match the physical and electrical constraint given by the size of the satellite. First an appropriate actuator configuration, must be found and implemented. This includes interface circuitry, and a micro processor which can handle the control algorithms. Two controllers must be design, one to detumble the satellite after separation from the launch vehicle, and one which can stabilise the satellite at a give ref- erence. To accomplish this, a mathematical model of the system is derived. For detumbling a B-dot controller is derived, tested and implemented. For normal op- eration two controllers will be derived and tested. First a constant gain controller based on periodic op- timal control is setup. Then a controller based on LMI is derived. Both controllers are tested for both nadir and inertial pointing stability. The costant gain controller is found to have the best overall perfor- mance and is therefore implemented.},

abstract = {CubeSats have become a viable means by which to conduct a variety of small-scale experiments in space. They are relatively inexpensive to build and launch, but the limited size of CubeSats poses some design challenges. For CubeSat missions requiring active 3-axis attitude control, magnetorquers have been a more common means of actuation due to their small size, weight, and power requirements. However, 3-axis magnetic actuation has only been proven to allow periodic controllability, not time-instantaneous controllability. The present work applies a fuzzy classifier system to a PD-type control law for a 3-axis magnetically actuated CubeSat subject to gravity gradient torque.},

De- signing an attitude control system (ACS) to fit within the envelope of CINEMA is a critical development process for the mission. The ACS design, implementation and tests for this type of spacecraft have to rely mainly on simulations. A complete simulation of the space- craft environment and the ACS system is created to verify the ACS design. The simulation verifies that the ACS is capable of achieving the desired orientation without ground com- munication, while maintaining a power and thermal-safe orientation.},

abstract = {In this paper, we apply nonlinear controllability t h e ory to the attitude dynamics of a magnetically actuated spacecraft in a Keplerian orbit in the geomagnetic field. The variation of t,he geomagnetic field along the orbit makes the dynamical equations time varying in nature. Hence we first present sufficient conditions for accessibil-ity, strong accessibility and controllability of a general time-varying system. We apply these sufficient condi-tions to show that the attitude dynamics of a spacecraft actuated by three magnetic actuators and subjected to a general time-varying magnetic field are strongly accessi-ble if the magnetic field and its first two time derivatives are linearly independent at every instant. In addition, if the magnetic field is periodic in time, then the attitude dynamics of the spacecraft are controllable. These results are used to show that the attitude dynamics of a space-craft actuated by three magnetic actuators in a closed Keplerian orbit in a nonrotating dipole approximation of the geomagnetic field are strongly accessible and control-lable if the orbital plane contains neither the geomagnetic equator nor the geomagnetic poles.},

abstract = {Magnetic torquing is attractive as means of control for small satellites. The actuation principle is to use the interaction between the earth's magnetic field and a magnetic field generated by a coil set in the satellite. This control principle is inherently time-varying, and difficult to use because control torques can only be generated perpendicular to the local geomagnetic field vector. This has been a serious obstacle for using magnetorquer based control for three-axis stabilization of a low earth orbit satellite. The problem of controlling the spacecraft attitude using only magnetic torquing is realized in the form of a infinite horizon periodic controller. BT  - Optimal magnetic attitude control},
